## Branches and Tags

The **master** branch carries all the items that have been referred to in one of our blogs; the **dev** branch carries stuff that we are working on and that will (probably) make it into a publication at one point. Note that the dev branch generally does not carry the items from the master branch, unless we are currently working on them.

> **WARNING: those two branches are subject to unannounced history rewrites**

The items in the master branch are subject to occasional updates, so when looking at an old blog post there might be an inconsistency between what has been written in the post, and the linked item. Unless we forget we will create a tag corresponding to the publication date for each of our posts (eg 20140823) which allows to retrieve the item as it was when the post was created. Alternatively, the post might be linking to the tagged version, in which case one might want to look at the master branch for updates.
